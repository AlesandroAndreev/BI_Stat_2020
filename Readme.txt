This branch contains the analysis of statistical data obtained in the framework of the experiment put forward by M. Mahiuddin Ahmed et al. The branch includes the following data:

1) Readme;
2) Practical task;
3) Analyzed data;
4) The code itself is in .rmd format;
5) The result of the work of the code.

To check the functionality of the code, the archive can be downloaded and run on your computer. For the code to work correctly, it must be in the same folder with the analyzed data and nothing else.

Take sure you have Java Development Kit installed and correctly registered in R.
If in doubt, re-run "R CMD javareconf" as root.
